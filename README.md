## Proposal

I plan on building a text summarization model to help summarize lengthy Medium articles. I will be making an interface where the user can select which Medium article they want to be summarized. For this project, I will be using a Kaggle dataset of Medium articles and will summarize them on demand using my text summarization model. I think this is a fascinating use case as these articles can get pretty lengthy sometimes and getting a gist of what the article says can help readers decide if they want to commit to reading the entire thing. This can be extended in the future to directly get articles from Medium, instead of relying on a dataset of articles. I will maily be utilizing SpaCy Python library to do the text summarization. The output should be a short summarization of the article and I will compare the contents of the two and see if the summarization is valid. 

I plan on using Python for this project.

Main tasks and time cost:

1. Cleaning and extracting data from the dataset - 6 hours
2. Building an user-friendly interface - 5 hours
3. Building a summarizer - 6 hours
4. Testing the results - 3 hours

Total time - 20 hours
